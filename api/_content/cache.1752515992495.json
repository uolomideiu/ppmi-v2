The University of Washington will analyze the brain tissue and provide a summary of the findings to your legally authorized representative. Indiana University, which leads the PPMI Biorepository Core, will extract a sample of DNA (genetic material) from the donated tissue. De-identified data from these analyses will be added to the PPMI database for use by qualified researchers.

You and/or your LAR will sign a form indicating interest in donating brain tissue. Then, you will share basic information including your address and the address/contact information of anyone that would be involved in your end-of-life care.

Therefore, we ensure all persons involved with your care are aware of the planned brain tissue donation.\"},{\"title\":\"How can I talk to my loved ones about brain donation?\",\"content\":\"Although it may not be an easy topic to address, it’s important to speak with your loved ones about brain donation. Talking with loved ones early on in the decision-making process may also help reduce stress. Share with your loved ones the impact of brain donation.
